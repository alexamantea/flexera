General
For the coding questions, I used the language I am most familiar at the moment, been working with it for some time now.


Rochambo:

I assumed that each game has a maximum of 3 rounds.
Not sure if this is the expected behaviour, wasnt clear from the question description.
I also added how many ties and losses would be in each game.
